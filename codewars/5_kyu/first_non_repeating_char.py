# Write a function named first_non_repeating_letterâ€  that takes a string input, and returns the first character that is not repeated anywhere in the string.

# For example, if given the input 'stress', the function should return 't', since the letter t only occurs once in the string, and occurs first in the string.

# As an added challenge, upper- and lowercase letters are considered the same character, but the function should return the correct case for the initial letter. For example, the input 'sTreSS' should return 'T'.

# If a string contains all repeating characters, it should return an empty string ("");

def first_non_repeating_letter(s):
    lower_s = s.lower()

    for let in s:
        if lower_s.count(let.lower()) == 1:
            return let

    return ''



print(first_non_repeating_letter('sTress') == 'T')
